# Technical Info

### High-Resolution scaling
Some in-game fonts do not scale well on High DPI displays. **bfme-resfix** uses the Windows Display Scaling factor and recommends the most appropriate resolution for the screen. Example: *On a 3840 x 2160 screen with 200% scaling, 1920 x 1080 is recommended. Choosing a higher resolution like 2560 x 1440 can work depending on user preference, screen size and viewing distance.*

### Retaining Zoom & Fog
To match the original Zoom level, the following **Camera Angle** and **Height Multiplier** are applied to each map's original heights. 
The same values are used to retain the original Fog level. Each Aspect Ratio requires its respective *Maps.big*-file to match the original look.

| Aspect Ratio | Camera Angle | Height Multiplier | Min. Height | Max. Height | 
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| 4:3          | 37.5째        | 1,000             | 120         | 300         |
| 16:9         | 35째          | 1,333             | 160         | 400         |
| 21:9         | 32.5째        | 1,750             | 210         | 525         |
| 32:9 [1]     | 30째          | 2,667             | 320         | 800         |

[1] *Engine breaks with 32:9 settings, displaying a black curtain at max. height 800. Reducing the height would effectively decrease the horizontal FOV compared to other aspect ratios, hence it is not advised.*
